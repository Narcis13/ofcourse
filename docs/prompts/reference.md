# Master Prompt: Generate Comprehensive Module Reference Guide (HTML-Aligned Version)

## Core Mission
Transform the provided module outline and interactive HTML page into a comprehensive, print-friendly reference guide that serves as a complete learning resource for teenage beginners (15-18 years old). The output should be a detailed, well-structured document that perfectly aligns with the interactive HTML experience, providing both theoretical understanding and practical implementation details that complement the hands-on learning.

## Critical Enhancement: HTML Alignment
The reference guide MUST align with the provided interactive HTML page by:
- Using the exact same code examples from the HTML
- Referencing the interactive exercises and explaining them in detail
- Providing additional context for each HTML section
- Offering deeper explanations of concepts briefly introduced in the HTML
- Including solutions and extended explanations for HTML quizzes
- Maintaining consistent terminology and variable names

## Example Section (HTML-Aligned)

```markdown
## Chapter 2: Variables - Your Digital Storage Boxes {#chapter-2}

### Your HTML Journey with Variables

In Section 2 of the interactive module, you discovered variables by actually creating and using them. Remember when you changed "Your Name" to your actual name and saw it appear in the output? That was your first real variable in action!

### Diving Deeper Than the HTML Could

The HTML showed you that variables store information, but let's understand what's actually happening behind the scenes.

#### Breaking Down Your First Exercise

In the HTML, you worked with this code:

```javascript
let myName = "Your Name";  // You changed this
let myAge = 16;           // You updated this too
let favoriteGame = "Minecraft";  // And personalized this

console.log("Hi, I'm " + myName);
```

When you clicked "Run Code" and saw your actual name appear, here's what JavaScript did:

1. **Created a space in memory** labeled `myName`
2. **Stored your text** in that space
3. **Retrieved it** when `console.log` needed it
4. **Combined it** with other text using `+`

The HTML couldn't show you this process, but understanding it helps you debug when things go wrong!

### Why Your Dark Mode Toggle Worked

Remember in Section 6 when you built the dark mode feature? It used variables in a special way:

```javascript
const savedTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme');
```

This is still a variable, but it's:
- **Persistent**: Survives page refreshes (unlike the variables in your first exercise)
- **Conditional**: Might be null if no theme was saved
- **Constant**: Uses `const` instead of `let` because it won't change after creation
