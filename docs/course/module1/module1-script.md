🔥 HIGH ENERGY

YO! What's good, future developers! Welcome to Module 1, and let me tell you - TODAY is the day your coding journey gets REAL!

[0:05]
First things first - pause this video RIGHT NOW if you don't have the Module 1 page open. You should see "Module 1: The Coder's Toolkit 🧰" at the top with that sick purple header. Got it? Cool, cool, cool.

[0:15]
*[checks imaginary phone]* Everyone ready? Alright, let's GO!

So check this out - you know how every superhero has their origin story? Like, Peter Parker gets bit by a spider, Tony Stark builds his first suit in a cave? Well TODAY... today you're setting up YOUR superhero lair! 

[0:30]
Except instead of web-shooters or arc reactors, we're talking about VS Code, Git, and your first LIVE website. And honestly? *[leans in conspiratorially]* This is way cooler because YOU'RE actually gonna build stuff that real people can use!

[HTML SECTION: section-0]
[0:45]
Look at your screen - you should be on the Welcome section. See where it says "Quick check: Why do developers need a special setup?" Go ahead and click one of those options...

[0:55]
*[waits a beat]* 

Did you pick "To write code faster and catch mistakes early"? NICE! If you picked something else, no worries - the point is, having the right tools makes you like 10x more powerful. It's like trying to play Fortnite on a potato vs. a gaming PC, you feel me?

[1:10]
📚 FOCUSED

Alright, click that "Next: VS Code Setup" button at the bottom. Let's get into the good stuff!

[HTML SECTION: section-1]
[1:20]
BOOM! Welcome to Section 1 - Setting Up VS Code. This is where the magic begins!

So... VS Code. *[types in air]* Visual Studio Code. Sounds fancy, right? But here's what it REALLY is - imagine if Google Docs and Discord had a baby, but for code. It's where you're gonna write EVERYTHING.

[1:35]
See that spoiler section that says "Why VS Code and not something else?" Click that bad boy!

[1:40]
*[reads along]* See? Free, works everywhere, has extensions... It's basically the iPhone of code editors. Everyone uses it, it just WORKS, and you can customize it however you want.

[1:50]
Now, if you haven't downloaded VS Code yet, pause the video, go to code.visualstudio.com, and get it installed. I'll wait... 

*[taps fingers on desk]* 

[2:00]
Back? Awesome! Now scroll down to where it says "Essential Extensions". These are like... okay, you know how you can't use Instagram without filters? Extensions are like filters for your code - they make everything better!

[2:15]
Here's what we NEED to install:
- Live Server - this one's CRUCIAL. It's gonna let you see your websites update in real-time!
- Prettier - makes your code look *[chef's kiss]* professional
- Auto Rename Tag - trust me, this will save you SO much frustration
- Color Highlight - you'll actually SEE the colors in your code!
- GitLens - we'll use this later for time travel (yeah, I said time travel!)

[2:35]
[INTERACTIVE ELEMENT: vscode-demo]
Okay, okay, okay - scroll down to that "Try It Yourself!" section. You see that code editor with the dark background? That's what VS Code looks like!

[2:45]
In that editor, there's already some HTML code. This is your FIRST webpage! Go ahead and change where it says "I'm learning to code with VS Code!" to something else. Maybe like... "I'm about to become a coding legend!" or whatever you want!

[3:00]
You changed it? Good! Now... *[drumroll sound]* HIT THAT GREEN "PREVIEW HTML" BUTTON!

[3:05]
🚀 PEAK ENERGY

YOOOOO! Look at that! You see that preview below? That's YOUR webpage! YOU just wrote HTML code and made something appear on screen! Let's GOOOOO!

[3:15]
*[calms down slightly]* Okay, okay, I know it's simple, but like... you just MADE something! From nothing! That's literally how every website starts!

[3:25]
Hit that "Next: Power Shortcuts" button. Time to learn some ninja moves!

[HTML SECTION: section-2]
[3:35]
📚 FOCUSED

Alright, Section 2 - VS Code Power User Shortcuts. This is where you go from typing like a normal person to coding like you're in The Matrix!

[3:45]
Look at that shortcut table. I know, I know - it looks like a lot. But here's the thing... you know how you can type on your phone without looking? These shortcuts are gonna become just as natural.

[3:55]
The MOST important ones? 
- Ctrl+S (or Cmd+S on Mac) - SAVE YOUR WORK! I cannot stress this enough!
- Ctrl+Z - Undo. You WILL make mistakes. This is your time machine!
- Ctrl+/ - Comments out code. Super useful when debugging!

[4:10]
[INTERACTIVE ELEMENT: shortcut-practice]
Scroll down to the practice area. See that code with the sayHello function? 

[4:20]
Try this with me - click anywhere on line 5 (the first console.log line), then press Ctrl+D (or Cmd+D). See how it selected "console.log"? Press it again... BOOM! It selected the NEXT one too! One more time... TRIPLE SELECTION!

[4:35]
Now type something else, like "alert" - watch how it changes ALL THREE AT ONCE! That's the power of multi-cursor editing, baby!

[4:45]
😌 CALM

Oh, and check out that spoiler about Emmet shortcuts. Click it open...

[4:50]
*[excited whisper]* This is actually insane. Type an exclamation mark and hit Tab in VS Code, and it gives you an ENTIRE HTML page structure. It's like having autocomplete for entire websites!

[5:00]
Alright, moving on! Click "Next: File Organization"!

[HTML SECTION: section-3]
[5:10]
📚 FOCUSED

Section 3 - Project Organization Like a Pro. Okay, real talk? This might seem boring, but it's SO important. It's like... imagine trying to find your favorite hoodie but your room looks like a tornado hit it. That's what bad file organization does to your code!

[5:25]
Look at those file naming rules. Let me break it down:
- Always use lowercase. "index.html" not "Index.HTML"
- No spaces! Use hyphens. "my-cool-page.html" not "my cool page.html"
- Be descriptive! "contact-form.css" tells you EXACTLY what it is!

[5:40]
See that file tree structure below? That's how pros organize their projects. You've got folders for CSS, JavaScript, images... everything has its place!

[5:50]
[QUIZ REFERENCE: q3]
Quick quiz time! Scroll down to "Which filename follows best practices?"

[5:55]
Think about it... remember, no spaces, lowercase...

[6:00]
Did you pick "hero-section.css"? PERFECT! See how it's lowercase, uses a hyphen instead of a space, and tells you exactly what it styles? That's what we want!

[6:10]
Let's keep moving! Hit "Next: Terminal Basics"!

[HTML SECTION: section-4]
[6:20]
🔥 HIGH ENERGY

OH SNAP! We're at the Terminal section! This is where you become a TRUE hacker! 

[6:25]
*[types dramatically on keyboard]* 

You know those movies where hackers are typing green text on black screens? That's basically what we're doing, except it's REAL and actually useful!

[6:35]
Click on that spoiler that explains Terminal vs GUI...

[6:40]
So yeah, GUI is clicking with your mouse like a regular person. Terminal is typing commands like a BOSS. And honestly? Once you get used to it, terminal is SO much faster for certain things.

[6:50]
Look at that command table. These are your basic survival commands:
- `pwd` - "Print Working Directory" - basically "where am I?"
- `ls` - "List" - "what's in here?"
- `cd` - "Change Directory" - "let me go over there"
- `mkdir` - "Make Directory" - "create a new folder"

[7:05]
[INTERACTIVE ELEMENT: terminal-sim]
Yo, this is cool - scroll down to the Terminal Simulator! Type `pwd` in that black box and hit "Run Command"!

[7:15]
See that? It shows `/Users/student/projects/my-website` - that's telling you where you are in your computer's file system!

[7:25]
Now type `ls` and run it...

[7:30]
LOOK AT THAT! It's showing you all the files in your project! index.html, style.css, images folder... This is exactly what you'd see in VS Code's file explorer, but in text form!

[7:40]
😌 CALM

Try `mkdir my-awesome-folder` ... See? "Directory created successfully." You just made a folder using only your keyboard! 

[7:50]
I know terminal seems weird at first, but trust me - in a few weeks you'll be navigating your computer faster than ever. It's like learning keyboard shortcuts for life!

[8:00]
Ready for something REALLY cool? Click "Next: Git Basics"!

[HTML SECTION: section-5]
[8:10]
📚 FOCUSED

Section 5 - Git, Your Code Time Machine! Okay, this is probably THE most important tool you'll learn. Like, for real for real.

[8:20]
You ever been writing an essay, and then you accidentally delete a paragraph and can't get it back? Or you save over your file and lose the good version? Git makes sure that NEVER happens with your code!

[8:30]
Think of Git like... *[thinking]* ...like having save points in a video game. You know how in Zelda you can go back to any shrine you've been to? Git lets you go back to any point in your code's history!

[8:45]
Look at those Git commands. Don't worry about memorizing them all right now. The main ones are:
- `git init` - start tracking a project
- `git add` - stage your changes (like selecting files to upload)
- `git commit` - save a snapshot (like taking a photo of your code)
- `git push` - upload to the cloud (GitHub)

[9:00]
[INTERACTIVE ELEMENT: git-practice]
Let's try the Git simulator! In that code editor, you can see a typical Git workflow. Hit "Run Git Commands"!

[9:10]
See how it says "Initialized empty Git repository"? That's like telling Git "Hey, start watching this folder!"

[9:20]
Then `git status` shows you what's changed... `git add` prepares your files... and `git commit` saves that snapshot forever!

[9:30]
😌 CALM

Oh, and click that spoiler about "Writing Good Commit Messages"...

[9:35]
*[laughs]* Yeah, we've all written terrible commit messages. "asdfasdf"? "stuff"? NAH! Your future self will hate you!

[9:45]
Good messages are like leaving notes for yourself. "Add contact form to homepage" tells you EXACTLY what you did. Six months from now, you'll thank yourself!

[9:55]
Alright, ready for the moment you've been waiting for? Click "Next: Deploy to GitHub Pages"!

[HTML SECTION: section-6]
[10:05]
🚀 PEAK ENERGY

YO YO YO! This is IT! Section 6 - Deploy Your First Website! We're about to put your code on the ACTUAL INTERNET where ANYONE can see it!

[10:15]
*[stands up excitedly]* 

I'm not even joking - by the end of this section, you'll have a real website with a real URL that you can send to your friends, your family, put on your Instagram... WHEREVER!

[10:25]
Look at that deployment checklist. If you don't have a GitHub account yet, pause the video and go make one at github.com. It's free, takes like 2 minutes.

[10:35]
[INTERACTIVE ELEMENT: deploy-html]
Scroll down to "Create Your Deployment Files". See that code editor? That's a complete website ready to deploy!

[10:45]
Look at this code... it's got that gradient background, the celebration emoji, even JavaScript that shows today's date! Hit that "Preview Your Site" button!

[10:55]
*[chef's kiss]* Beautiful! This is what the world is gonna see!

[11:00]
📚 FOCUSED

Now here's what you gotta do:
1. Create a new repository on GitHub called `[yourusername].github.io`
2. Initialize Git in your project (remember `git init`?)
3. Add your files with `git add .`
4. Commit with `git commit -m "My first website!"`
5. Connect to GitHub and push!

[11:15]
The magic happens when you name your repo `[yourusername].github.io` - GitHub automatically knows to host it as a website!

[11:25]
😌 CALM

Take your time with this part. It might take a few minutes for GitHub to build your site. But once it's live... *[mind blown gesture]* ...you're officially a web developer with a published website!

[11:35]
When you're done deploying, click "Next: Final Challenge"!

[HTML SECTION: section-7]
[11:45]
🔥 HIGH ENERGY

FINAL BOSS TIME! Section 7 - Put It All Together!

[11:50]
You've learned SO MUCH! VS Code setup ✓ Terminal commands ✓ Git ✓ Your first deployment ✓ Now let's see if you really got it!

[11:58]
[QUIZ REFERENCE: q7a]
First challenge - "Which VS Code shortcut comments out a line?"

[12:05]
Remember what we practiced earlier? Think about it...

[12:10]
If you picked Ctrl+/ (or Cmd+/) - YESSS! You've been paying attention!

[12:15]
[QUIZ REFERENCE: q7b]
Next one - "What Git command saves a snapshot of your code?"

[12:20]
This is the one that's like taking a photo of your code...

[12:25]
`git commit`! That's the one! See how this stuff is starting to stick?

[12:30]
[INTERACTIVE ELEMENT: final-challenge]
Alright, here's the BIG challenge. You need to create a personal card with your name and a fun fact!

[12:40]
Look at that starter code. You've got the basic HTML structure, some CSS for the body... but that card needs YOUR touch!

[12:50]
📚 FOCUSED

Here's what you need to do:
1. Replace "Your Name" with your actual name in an `<h1>` tag
2. Add a fun fact about yourself after "Fun fact:"
3. Style that `.card` class - give it a background, some padding, maybe a border?

[13:05]
*[typing sounds]* 

Maybe something like:
```css
.card {
    background: white;
    padding: 2rem;
    border-radius: 10px;
    box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
}
```

[13:20]
Take about 2 minutes to make this your own. Make it represent YOU! Change colors, add more text, go crazy!

[13:30]
*[waits patiently]*

[14:30]
Done? Awesome! Hit that "Submit Challenge" button!

[14:35]
🚀 PEAK ENERGY

DID YOU SEE THAT?! "Challenge Master! 🎯" LETS GOOOOOO!

[14:40]
You just:
- Set up a professional development environment
- Learned terminal commands
- Used Git to track your code
- Deployed a website to the internet
- Built a personal card component

[14:50]
That's not beginner stuff - that's REAL DEVELOPER work!

[14:55]
😌 CALM

Look at your progress bar at the top. See how it's filling up? That's your journey visualized! Every section you complete, every challenge you conquer, you're getting closer to becoming the developer you're meant to be!

[15:10]
🔥 HIGH ENERGY

Now for the moment of truth... Scroll down and HIT THAT "COMPLETE MODULE!" BUTTON!

[15:15]
*[waits for achievement popup]*

BOOM! "Module 1 Complete! 🎉" 

[15:20]
*[gets emotional]* 

Yo, I'm actually proud of you right now. Like, for real. You just set up everything you need to build ANYTHING on the web. You've got your tools, you know the basics, and you've got your first website live on the internet!

[15:35]
📚 FOCUSED

Here's what's coming next in Module 2: We're diving into HTML - the skeleton of every website. You're gonna learn how to structure content like a pro, build forms, create navigation... basically, you're gonna learn the language that built the entire internet!

[15:50]
But for now? Celebrate! Share your GitHub Pages link with someone! Post it on your story! You EARNED this!

[16:00]
😌 CALM

Remember - every expert was once a beginner. Every website you've ever used started with someone setting up their development environment, just like you did today.

[16:10]
The only difference between you and them? Time and practice. And you just took the first step!

[16:20]
🔥 HIGH ENERGY

Alright, future developers - that's Module 1 in the books! Drop a comment with your GitHub Pages URL - I wanna see what you built!

[16:30]
Until next time... keep coding, keep building, and remember - you're not just learning to code. You're learning to CREATE!

[16:40]
PEACE OUT! ✌️
